					<description><![CDATA[Exactly Radwan, any time you want to return collection its better to return it lazy, better for performance and for usability,

Think about it, why return the whole collection at once while you can lazy return it ? and support Linq2Object laziness ? 

This apply to repositories or any other logic software architecture not only when making extensions. as there is many situations when you must for-each or loops no matter what, where and select cant be out of the box solution to all situations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mohamedradwan.com/2010/12/25/yield-return-what-does-it-mean/#comment-101&quot;&gt;mohammedumar&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for you comment Mohamed, but you missed my intent here!
All what I want to say as long as I just use the built in extension LINQ methods, no need to write for each by hand, because I just use the extension method like where or select, but I didn&#039;t say by using select or where it will not use for each, I mean I will not write for each as before, I hope you get my point :-) 

This of course unless I create my own extension or I just need to iterate over any collection to return some of them in this case sure if you are not use yield it&#039;s a crime as you said :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice explanation bro, 
But let‚Äôs discuss it more‚Ä¶..
Thinking that yield is useless or its just to ease your job instead of writing more code is totally wrong.
‚ÄúYield return, it‚Äôs a very strong keyword, in in spite of I will not use it because, with LINQ to object you don‚Äôt need for-each or yield return‚Äù.
This is the exact thing I don‚Äôt agree with you on. every time you use where or select or mostly any LINQ extension method you use for-each

check my post here, i couldn&#039;t post much in the comment:
