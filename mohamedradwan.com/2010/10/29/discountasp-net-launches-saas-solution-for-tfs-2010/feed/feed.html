Thanks Ahmed for you comment.

I think you are right for company that has this number of developers but for small companies that can&#039;t afford MS Partner maybe it will be fair enough and don&#039;t forget that you don&#039;t need TFS licenses, administration and configuration which will increase the cost too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting.

I think it is too expensive. 20$ / User each month.

If my team is 7 so we will need 20$ * 7 = 140$ / month.

Which means we need 140$ * 12 = 1680$ / Year.

Which equals 1680$ = 9,685.21 EGP ~ 10000 EGP per year.

I can use any program Microsoft offers and host my TFS in my Server for my self and it will not cost me this much much money!]]></description>
