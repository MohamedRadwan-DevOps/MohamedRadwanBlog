					<description><![CDATA[Well, it should be fair enough but it is not that good because of many things, first it is a large in size, second, you need to setup versions of IE itself to be able to view them on the SuperView which is the big issue, why should I search for IE5, IE6, IE7 to download them for example on Windows7 to be able to view them just on the SuperView where software like IETester provide such function on small free utility :-) .

I guess microsoft has to embedded how every browser render the page without actually having them on the machine, this is should not be that hard, they can even/should support other browsers if they want to make value of that software, but as a designer, I wasn&#039;t that happy of testing SuperPreview first time comparing to the other tools i&#039;ve used, the only value as you said, giving the different positions and highlight the different rending of the same object on different views or browsers :P

Thanks for the post and see you soon ISA :-)]]></description>
