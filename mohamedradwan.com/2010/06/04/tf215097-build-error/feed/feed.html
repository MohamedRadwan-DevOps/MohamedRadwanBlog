					<description><![CDATA[Indeed , this is a problem with my workflow .
Because , I have tested with another workflow template and it works fine .

I don&#039;t understand why it works for the Continous and Scheduled mode and not with the GC. 

The only difference is the fact that in Gated Check-in , my local changes are put in a shelveset .]]></description>

You need to debug the process, my idea that the customization that made to the process corrupted the Gated-cheked-in but you didn&#039;t find out that problem  because during the customization you didn&#039;t try work with Gated-checked-in, you maybe tried other trigger, If I were you, I will try to use a new build definition with Gated-checked-in and if it worked, I will debug the process till find the error.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello , 

In  GC mode , i always have the same issue TF270012: There is no shelveset available to check in.

The Build controller is available and Online . i have many builds in CI mode and Scheduled mode wich run every day without any problem. but not in Gated Check-in mode .

my builds use a custom workflow template based on the default one (TFS 2010, Visual Studio 2013)

The gated Check-in activity is out of &quot;Run on Agent&quot; Sequence . So i suppose that the check-in is executed by the controller .

Any idea ?

Thank you for your help
