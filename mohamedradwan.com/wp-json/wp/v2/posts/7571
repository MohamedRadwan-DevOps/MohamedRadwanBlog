In this post, I&#8217;ll focus on an important unit of Agile software development process, which is <strong>User Story<\/strong>.\u00a0User stories are representing smaller units of work, that needs to be implemented in the sprint.<\/p>\n<p>Starting the project with the <a href=\"http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Agile methodology<\/strong><\/a> you will start with the creation of <strong>Product Backlog<\/strong>, where you will be adding<strong> Product Backlog Items (PBI&#8217;s)<\/strong> with the description which will be usually written in user story format.<\/p>\n<p>This might seem like a simple job to do, but you would want to consider some basic rules and recommendations before starting adding the description of <strong>PBI<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span>You can find more information about <strong>DevOps<\/strong> in the following post: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/10\/31\/devops-the-three-stage-conversation-people-process-products\/\">DevOps: The Three Stage Conversation &#8211; People, Process, Products<\/a> which describes the basic principles of <strong>DevOps<\/strong>. This post will be especially helpful to those for whom DevOps is still a new concept. If you prefer a deeper view on this topic, have a look at the following guide: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/03\/published-a-quick-guide-about-basic-principles-of-devops\/\">quick guide about Basic Principles of DevOps<\/a>, which presents an overview of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/vs\/devops\/\">DevOps <\/a>process and practices, describing \u201cthe big picture\u201d, while still maintaining the high level of detail.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Definition\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Definition of user story<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Considering working with <strong>Agile methodology<\/strong>, a user story is a high-level description of the PBI&#8217;s requirements in the <strong>Product Backlog<\/strong>. It has to be the right size, not too detailed and not too abstract and it has to have just enough information that development team can start with the estimation of implementation effort.<\/p>\n<p>A user story is expressing the small piece business value, deliverable in one sprint. Deliverable doesn&#8217;t mean just developing the <strong>PBI<\/strong> but also testing in the same sprint. So, it has to be small or big enough to be developed and tested in the same sprint.<\/p>\n<p>My high recommendation for the creation of <strong>User Stories<\/strong> would also be, to make the meaningful, short, but yet explanatory title of the user story. Considering that we are developing a game, I would highly recommend avoiding <strong>User story titles<\/strong> in this format:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game rules<\/li>\n<li>Game characters<\/li>\n<li>Main menu<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rather than having such titles, I would personally prefer to use User Story titles, as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop basic game rules in xy format<\/li>\n<li>List all available game characters<\/li>\n<li>Display main menus in navigation bar<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another example of the Agile backlog is shown on the image below. This backlog was built for e-commerce purposes and you can understand from the image below that each PBI is a separate story, which means that it can be implemented without any dependencies on other PBI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7583 size-full\" title=\"Backlog_PBIs Kanban board VSTS\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1.png\" alt=\"Backlog_PBIs Kanban board VSTS\" width=\"1171\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1.png 1171w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1-300x136.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1-768x348.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Backlog_PBIs-1-1024x464.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1171px) 100vw, 1171px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>If you want to know more about maintaining the backlog in a proper way, you can visit the following post: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/30\/key-tips-for-maintaining-good-product-backlog-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Key Tips For Maintaining Good Product Backlog in Agile and Scrum<\/a>.

Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This question is covering the goal of the feature that we are building.

In this way, the <strong>team can focus on providing a business solution to solve users problems<\/strong>, rather than just writing the code.<\/p>\n<p>Although there is no official template that Agile uses or forces, there is a common and widely used template to write a good user story, that uses the following form:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><em>As a &lt;role&gt; I want &lt;something\/function&gt; so that &lt;goal\/benefit\/value&gt;.<\/em><\/h2>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> Read detailed explanation about all types of <strong>Scrum and Agile meetings<\/strong> (Sprint Planning, Stand-up, Grooming, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/scrum\/sprint-planning\">Sprint<\/a> Review, Retrospective Meeting) in my past post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/27\/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile\/\">Types of meetings in Scrum and Agile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #003366;\"><strong>Let&#8217;s try to take a look at two different examples, using the same template for the same task:<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Task is: Implement Trello Integration with VSTS<\/p>\n<p>A poor example of a user story, \u00a0with an attempt to respect such template would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4><em>As a user, I want VSTS to integrate with Trello so that I can see\u00a0the team&#8217;s board.<\/em><\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>A better example of the same user story:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4><em>As a user, I want VSTS to integrate with Trello so that I can see on boards\u00a0when certain events happen in my\u00a0team project.<\/em><\/h4>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In example below, you&#8217;ll see the User Story in the PBI, which is part of an existing Product backlog.

As explained in previous lines of this post, it might seem a very easy job to write a user story, but many Product Owners, even the ones with good backgrounds and experience, are making some of the most common mistakes, which are leading in the opposite direction, as we would want to. Here is some of the most often mistakes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Too detailed user stories<\/strong>, where I believe that most of the Product Owners do this with very good intention, but at the end, they end up with huge business documentation, which is not at all what is needed in order to reach a good business value for the customer or end user.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Technical tasks are not user stories.<\/strong> In many of my projects, I saw examples where the developers are writing user stories for their own scenario, such as: &#8220;As a developer, I want to conclude the development of my code, so that I don&#8217;t need to come back to the same issue&#8221;. \u00a0This is leading to having non-working software and back to the waterfall approach.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Filling the blank spaces in the template.<\/strong> This is another issue that I&#8217;ve noticed while participating in different projects. People usually just want to finish their tasks and move on. Finishing the task as quickly as possible usually means having poor output, without including the business value and just trying to fill the template with anything, even if it has no sense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>In order to ensure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/continuous-integration\/\"><strong>Continuous Integration<\/strong><\/a>, we need to use proper <strong>deploying strategy<\/strong>.

In this part of development, as a good <strong>Product Owner<\/strong>, you would really want to consider putting the good effort in producing a well designed and quality backlog, containing just the right level of the user stories details, as this will be your basis for producing what business needs. It&#8217;s definitely not an easy task and you will need to have a good balance between sense and details.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that there is still so many other important parts of a user story. This post is just describing the main points and guidelines how to start writing good user stories, but there is even so much more to it. When we start adding more details to the user stories in grooming sessions, we start to define acceptance criteria and even wireframes, which are not covered in this post. All this parts are also very important parts and good Product Owner should know them by heart.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and feel free to leave your feedback or questions in the comments section below!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span>If you would like to know more about Azure deployments, have a look at the post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2018\/02\/12\/how-to-deploy-to-azure-using-team-services-release-management\/\">How to deploy to Azure using Team Services Release Management<\/a>.
