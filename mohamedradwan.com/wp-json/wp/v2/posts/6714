In this process testers will try to find the <strong>Bugs<\/strong>, using different scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important from many aspects, but from most important one is to measure the <strong>quality of the software<\/strong>. In software development process, it\u2019s very important to understand what are the possible risks for certain software implementation. There are many advantages for software development with software testing, such as: <strong>reducing the cost<\/strong> of development and the <strong>total cost of ownership<\/strong>, as well as ensuring <strong>proper behavior<\/strong> for the end-user and developing customer loyalty.<\/p>\n<h3>So, the main purpose of a testing job is <strong>to identify and report out software bugs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>which are then in later phases reviewed and prioritized in the process known also as <strong>Triage<\/strong>. In <strong>Triage<\/strong>\u00a0the bugs will be separated, selected and sorted and on <strong>Triage<\/strong> meetings sometimes also happens that team decides to raise the triage criteria bar, which means that some of the reported bugs will remain unfixed. Remain unfixed bugs are representing a\u00a0<strong>trade-off<\/strong> meaning that these bugs are less important due to the time limitations, budget or meeting the project scope. After the bug is fixed,<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s usually assigned back to the tester to verify it. Verification here means that tester will try to reproduce the bug and search for additional errors. Here it\u2019s very important to highlight the understanding of the <strong>Bug States<\/strong>, which are: <strong>Active, Closed<\/strong>, and <strong>Resolved<\/strong>. The meaning of <strong>Active state<\/strong> is clear and it means that bug is in process of investigation or fix. <strong>Closed state<\/strong> means that someone has verified that bug is fixed, but not everyone in team agreed or confirmed it. <strong>Resolved state<\/strong> implies that bug is fixed and that fix is verified.<\/p>\n<p>Before understanding the purpose of testing, it\u2019s also very important to understand the difference between software development methodologies which are used for management of those projects. They are divided into two main groups of development:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sequential and Iterative<\/strong>.<\/h3>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>To learn more about Agile Software Testing, have a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2018\/01\/30\/published-a-quick-guide-about-agile-software-testing\/\">quick guide about Agile Software Testing<\/a>. This guide presents the basic idea behind Agile methodology and its connection to software testing. It describes the structural idea of Agile and explains the importance of adaptation to changes in the fast-paced software development world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sequential development<\/strong> basically uses the waterfall method, which courses through a set of phases. In waterfall model of development, the team will finish each phase, before continuing with the next one. It requires a lot of organization and planning upfront and it\u2019s appropriate for big projects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Iterative model<\/strong> of development uses a short 2-3 week long sprints to finish a small portion of a project and then moves to next portion and so on. This model is incremental, delivers quickly, responds to changes and aims to get user feedback for each iteration. This model is using <strong>Agile methodology<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/07\/01\/introduction-to-software-testing\/1-waterfall-vs-agile-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6722\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6722\" title=\"1-waterfall-vs-agile software dev test\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-Waterfall-vs-Agile-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"1-waterfall-vs-agile software dev test\" width=\"763\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-Waterfall-vs-Agile-1-1.jpg 881w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-Waterfall-vs-Agile-1-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-Waterfall-vs-Agile-1-768x437.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc468496321\"><\/a>Software Testing Process<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Software Testing Process<\/strong> differs by used methodology, testing level and between organizations, but it will generally remain the same either the team is using Waterfall method or working by <a href=\"http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agile<\/a>.

Of course, the tester will not just look for any bug, he will perform the tests in accordance with the test plan. Which will have specified test cases.<\/p>\n<p>Here it\u2019s also important to mention that every test case should include Test Case ID or Number. Summary, any Related Requirements, Prerequisites, Procedure or the steps, Expected and Actual Result. Status showing if test failed or succeeded, notes, data about who created the test and when who executed the test. And when and also the information about Test Environment showing which OS and browser were used.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">\u00a0You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tfWCYXxeTmc\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">if you would like to find more information about how to integrate automated UI tests with Visual Studio build automation in order to be able to integrate with Continuous Integration &amp; Continuous Delivery Pipeline. First, you need to add test category and rebuild the application. Note that the build should be configured as a process. Not as a service in order to be able to run the automation UI. Afterwards I am going to commit EasyRepo UI Automation framework in Team Explorer. Changes in order to committed and synchronize the changes in my local EasyRepo on VSTS.

So, manual testing is conducted in accordance with the test case, which should be very well-defined and scoped.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side, the <a href=\"https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/dd380755(v=vs.110).aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Automated testing<\/strong><\/a> means that test will be performed by a computer and as a set of already predefined steps. Automated tests can be created and build in a way that they will run each time when a part of source code will be changed. Using the Automated tests allows you to run the tests unattended, to use fewer resources and to have more stability as there are no human errors present. Also, they are reducing the effort and spent time, they can have higher coverage and they are handling those repetitive and maybe even boring tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Both types of testing are very important. But it\u2019s important to note that <strong>Manual testing<\/strong> will take longer time for execution. But it doesn\u2019t require long set-up time as <strong>Automated testing<\/strong> does. Therefore <strong>Manual tests<\/strong> are good to use where they need to be run. From time to time or in cases when the cost of setting up the automation would exceed the desirable one and there would be no value of it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you would like to know more about this new developer service available on the <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/\">Azure<\/a> platform, you can have a look at the following post; <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/12\/more-about-azure-devtest-labs\/\">More about Azure DevTest Labs<\/a>.

It means that tester will play a role of a user. Which is not familiar with any background, for example how the code is working. Under Functional tests, there are many types of tests, such as Smoke testing, Regression testing, Usability testing \u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>Non-Functional testing<\/strong> represents a testing of a software for its non-functional elements.\u00a0 Such as how many people can log in the same time. Testing the application performance requirement and other non-functional characteristics of software systems. Some of the test types under Non-Functional testing are Performance Testing, Load Testing, Security Testing, Maintainability Testing, Endurance testing, etc.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc468496324\"><\/a>Teams and communication in software testing<\/h2>\n<p>In software, testing communication is very important.
