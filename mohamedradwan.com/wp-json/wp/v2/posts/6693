It is all about improving the joint effort between functions of <strong>Development<\/strong> and <strong>Operations<\/strong>. The <strong>DevOps<\/strong> methodology in a software world is often also referred as a methodology that overcomes the gap between <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2012\/07\/31\/im-just-professional-agile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Agile<\/strong><\/a> software development and operations, as it enables\u00a0a fluent process\u00a0for <strong>Continuous Development<\/strong> and <strong>Continuous Integration<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also very important to highlight that usage of <strong>DevOps<\/strong> methodology reduces the stress in communication.

When Development implement the changes, such as new features, bugs or fixes, they want to quickly roll out this changes to production. But once when software is already delivered, the operations departments wants to avoid to make the changes on the software. Here is where\u00a0<strong>DevOps<\/strong>\u00a0help to overcome\u00a0the gap between both teams.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Initially, there was <strong>&#8216;Agile Development&#8217;<\/strong>, when agility aspect was applied to operations it became <strong>&#8216;Agile Administration&#8217;<\/strong>, thus <strong>DevOps<\/strong> was formed.

The post describes a way to efficiently organize the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/backlogs\/create-your-backlog\">backlog<\/a> items allowing you to understand the requirements better, and providing you with higher level of detail of what is actually expected from the work or delivery perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Part 2\">The Three Stage Conversation &#8211; People, Process, Products<\/h3>\n<p><strong>DevOps<\/strong> is the correlation\u00a0of <strong>people<\/strong>, <strong>process<\/strong>, and <strong>products<\/strong> to enable continuous delivery of value to end users. The outcomes are tightly connected to ability for frequent releases and at the same time to keep the same level of quality.<\/p>\n<h4>People:<\/h4>\n<p>Thinking\u00a0of <strong>DevOps<\/strong> at a really high level, it&#8217;s first all about people. <strong>DevOps<\/strong> business, everybody that is involved, that needs to deliver value to the business is working very tightly together on a common goal of adding value to the customer. The latest study by <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/doc\/3139918\/survey-analysis-devops-adoption-survey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gartner<\/a><\/strong>, which involved 367 IT and\u00a0leading companies, from which 113 companies were using <strong>DevOps<\/strong>, showed that people issue is the biggest\u00a0concern\u00a0in the\u00a0share of interviewed participants. This study also revealed that the share of process and IT issues is on less lower level, than people issue. So we can think that having highly motivated people with good collaboration between teams is very important.<\/p>\n<h4>Process:<\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> The post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/09\/18\/user-stories-in-agile-world\/\">User stories in Agile world <\/a> focuses on an important unit of Agile software development process, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/work-items\/guidance\/agile-process-workflow\">User Story<\/a>. The post also describes some basic rules and recommendations you have to follow before adding the descriptions of <strong>PBI<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Next &#8211; <strong>DevOps<\/strong> is about process because even if you have those people that are good working together. But then you have got business process in a way that is really blocking innovation. For instance long chain advisory boards before they can do something or they are restricted to doing things in a certain way that really impedes that kind of innovation. The process of designing, building and testing software should be well presented to each individual team member. To make every team member aware of all parts of the the development process. The implementation of <strong>DevOps process<\/strong> into company is a hard work. As it completely changes the company&#8217;s structure as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s part of a bigger picture of <strong>DevOps<\/strong>. Enabling efficient flow of people working together and not having processes get in the way but having processes and practices that help enable that value deliver to your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Products:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>DevOps<\/strong> is not a tool or product. You can&#8217;t buy the <strong>DevOps, <\/strong>as <strong>DevOps<\/strong> is not a software, tool, process, company or person, it&#8217;s a methodology used especially by IT\u00a0professionals<strong>.<\/strong>\u00a0But there are products, tools and services that really help enable different <strong>DevOps<\/strong> practices and different teams can use to make things easier.

In a tremendous way that need continuous change to thrive in the competitive market. DevOps is not a software, tool, person or process, it&#8217;s way much more than that.
