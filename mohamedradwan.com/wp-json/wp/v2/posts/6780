The post also describes some basic rules and recommendations you have to follow before adding the descriptions of <strong>PBI<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For each user story, we develop a Product Backlog Item (PBI), assign proper tags to it based on publicity (Public\/Private). Main actor (Visitor\/Member\/Vendor\/Admin) and workflow type (Basic\/Advanced). Then we add its Acceptance Criteria. Each Acceptance Criteria Consists of two main parts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action Criteria<\/strong>: Are the options available for use and system respond to it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Input Validation Criteria<\/strong>: Used only when there is an input form being used to clarify each input type, boundaries, and importance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All PBIs are made on two levels:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial PBIs:<\/strong> Contains each PBI&#8217;s Title, Order, Tag, and Description (Description is the user story).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Detailed PBIs:<\/strong> Contains the initial PBIs content with enhancements to maintain consistency, plus the acceptance criteria.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All BWF PBIs are added to the source control in plain text format, so we can quickly trace any changes to it.<\/p>\n<p>Below is the sample for Vendor&#8217;s login Initial PBI.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/07\/26\/devopsthoughts-rabbit\/initial-pbi\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6782\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6782\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Initial-PBI.png\" alt=\"Initial PBI\" width=\"963\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Initial-PBI.png 963w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Initial-PBI-300x76.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Initial-PBI-768x195.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Another sample for Vendor&#8217;s login Detailed PBI.<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/07\/26\/devopsthoughts-rabbit\/detailed-pbi\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6783\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6783\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Detailed-PBI.png\" alt=\"Detailed PBI\" width=\"963\" height=\"581\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Detailed-PBI.png 963w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Detailed-PBI-300x181.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Detailed-PBI-768x463.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>Read about basic guidelines that you need to consider when building a <strong>product backlog<\/strong> in the following post, <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/12\/05\/requirements-epic-feature-user-story-task-size-and-estimation-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Requirements (Epic, Feature, User Story), Task Size and Estimation in Agile and Scrum<\/a> .

In DevOpsThoughts, we map each PBI to a single use case scenario. Each scenario has the following:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related PBI<\/strong>: The related PBI name &amp; Id.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Main Actors List:<\/strong> A list of all actors involved in the specified use case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pre-conditions:<\/strong> A list of all conditions that must be met before the use case starts in order for the use case to be valid. Example: Vendor has been logged into his account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Basic Flow:<\/strong> or what we call sometimes Happy Path is the normally expected flow for the use case with the default system settings, where the use case is expected to succeed as per main actors expectations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Flows: <\/strong>If available, alternative flows of a use case are the flows where main actors expectations are not met yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Post-conditions:<\/strong> A list of all conditions that must be met after the use case ends in order for the use case to be valid, example: Order was saved in the application.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also as in PBIs\u00a0 use case scenarios are divided into Initial and Detailed use case scenarios.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Initial Use Cases:<\/strong> Have the above structure.

The Website components aren&#8217;t only used for Rabbit. But the same is used for other versions of the project which is using the web as a presentation layer. Developing the website components uses PSDs as an input. Each PSD is converted &#8211; as it is &#8211; to be a separate web page. We gave much importance to utilize and minify all of the UI source files. After each PSD is converted, it is reviewed on two levels<\/p>\n<p><strong>External:<\/strong> Which is making sure that the web page matches 100% the provided PSD.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Internal:<\/strong> Which is checking for source code quality, readability and if the code is minified.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uzQFvYY0xiM\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">If you would like to see a walkthrough in order to know more information about how to develop a VSTS Extension and how to configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipeline. Described the agenda of the next series of videos. Learn how to deploy from different environments using different Publishers ID and VSTS accounts. In addition ! I am going to show how to develop a Single Page Application using HTML\/CSS\/JavaScript as a Front End developer.\u00a0 Also learn how to download VSS-SDK JavaScript. Library and how to use it and its manifest file (vss-extension.json). Afterwards how to pack the code into VSIX package using TFS command line. Upload it, share and install on VSTS account. At the end, I am going to configure Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipeline. And will discuss about errors which you may face it during this process and also sharing some notes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc487495905\"><\/a>Storyboarding<\/h1>\n<p>A Storyboarding is an illustration of a user interaction with application story. Not to be confused with user stories! In storyboarding we use visual images arrayed together for user interaction with the application to represent. Storyboards are easier to be remembered than other written Test Cases. As it shows the real UX, not just some text about it. In DevOpsThoughts we use <a href=\"https:\/\/products.office.com\/en\/powerpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Office&#8217;s PowerPoint <\/a>. which allows develops to make an animated representation of User interaction with application UI quickly with higher quality. If we look to the PSDs and Basic Mockups as a User Interface representation. We should consider Storyboarding to be the User Experience Representation.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc487495907\"><\/a>Conclusion<\/h1>\n<p>This post, as the second one in the blog post series about <strong>DevOpsThoughts Project. <\/strong>Is covering many details from the project development perspective. \u00a0It&#8217;s explaining for which purpose certain steps were developed.
