One of the most important parts of the software development life cycle is delivering your software to those who use it. Read more about releases in this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/repositories\/releasing-projects-on-github\/about-releases\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub document<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In this post are elaborated some recent improvements that are made to GitHub Releases in a new public beta version to make it easier to create and communicate compelling, high-quality releases while encouraging collaboration and engagement from the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From your GitHub repository, after clicking on the Releases button, we can imediatelly see the new UI with all new releases. For each release we can see the contributors&#8217; highlighted name and also all first-time contributors to the project will be recognized. All of the pull requests that are part of the release are automatically identified and a short summary is created for each of them. Also, we can see notes that were being automatically generated. This is the view with the new design Releases(shown on image 1), which is pretty much different from the older one named Tags.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10317\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10317\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-10317\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases-1024x488.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases-1024x488.png 1024w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases-300x143.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases-768x366.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases-1536x731.png 1536w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-1-New-view-Releases.png 1907w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10317\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 1 &#8211; New view Releases<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this example, I have a repository in which a configuration is used, release.yml(shown on image 2) in order to do a slightly more advanced form of release notes.

There is also a special label star \u201c*\u201d which should match anything that didn\u2019t match other labels.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10318\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10318\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-10318\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-2-Configuration-file-release.yml_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-2-Configuration-file-release.yml_.png 1021w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-2-Configuration-file-release.yml_-300x190.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-2-Configuration-file-release.yml_-768x487.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 2 &#8211; Configuration file release.yml<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to draft a new release, I will go into the Releases view (shown on image 3), choose one of the existing tags or create a new one (you can also search for your tag by typing).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10319\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10319\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-10319\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes-1024x459.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes-1024x459.png 1024w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes-300x135.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes-768x345.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes-1536x689.png 1536w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Image-3-Auto-generate-release-notes.png 1917w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 3 &#8211; Auto-generate release notes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clicking on the +Auto-generate release notes button will automatically generate a preview of our release notes.

In addition, the Releases UI with its new look gives communities the chance to celebrate those who contributed to each release by displaying the profile pictures of all contributors. Anyone on GitHub.com can react to releases with emoji or click to sponsor a project they wish to support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways to automatically trigger the release notes, the workflow that we mentioned above by triggering it directly in the UI, or to cut the release locally and push the tag upstream.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One more great feature if you are automating releases with GitHub Actions, is that there is an API that you can use in your workflows to integrate the new Automated Release Notes feature right into your existing actions pipeline.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <em>post<\/em> request should be sent (<em>\u2018\/repos\/${{ github.repository }}\/releases\u2019<\/em>) which will create a release. Check more details in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/rest\/reference\/repos#create-a-release\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API docs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the API will give you more flexibility to select the target commit and new tag name, give the previous tag name in case you want to generate release notes that go over more than one release. You can also pass a custom configuration.
