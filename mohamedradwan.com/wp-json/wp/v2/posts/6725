This type of testing is used already in early stages of software development and it\u2019s each test case is usually self-reliant. The purpose of <strong>Unit<\/strong> <strong>testing<\/strong> is to isolate parts of the software and to present the functionality of individual parts.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=drPJmvZZ0gs\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">if you would like to find more information about how to generate unit tests and calculate the code coverage on the local machine, and how to perform the same process with VSTS and the Build on the cloud.

It\u2019s basically testing of application in relation to its end users and to the rest of the system. Is a type of Black-Box testing in which the tester doesn\u2019t have any insights about software and its functionally. Under <strong>Functional Testing<\/strong>, there are also some other types, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Smoke<\/strong> <strong>testing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<li>which is software testing of most essential functions of a software, but not interfering with other smaller details. The term comes from hardware testing, where if the test didn\u2019t pass the smoke<\/li>\n<li><strong>Regression<\/strong> <strong>testing<\/strong> is done to check if the software still works even after the newly implemented changes. It\u2019s usually done after changing or adding new code, which can easily produce new bugs or changes that were not intended to be changed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Usability testing<\/strong> is done with the purpose of evaluating the product through users. It\u2019s executed with real users in order to estimate the usability of the product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Driven Testing<\/strong> is used when external data are loaded to existing functional test in order to extend Automated test cases. Test scripts contain test data with output values which are readable from data files, such as CVS files, Excel, CVS files, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keyword Testing<\/strong> where the keywords are specified for each action in the test case. The keywords can be keystrokes, mouse click or other action. Every keyword or set of keywords is then associated to function or action. This type of testing doesn\u2019t require any programming skills as it\u2019s very easy to design such test cases, so it\u2019s very appropriate type of testing for new testers or non-technical ones.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span>In order to ensure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/continuous-integration\/\"><strong>Continuous Integration<\/strong><\/a>, we need to use proper <strong>deploying strategy<\/strong>.

Once when the Automated testing for application confirms the proper tool should be selected for test execution. Here is important also to classify the appropriate framework, which is basically a set of automation guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After that, the scope of automation can be set. The scope of automation will define which features are important, technical usefulness, types of data in different scenarios and the complexity of each test case. It\u2019s important also to determine the automation strategy, which will define the design of framework, tools for automation and schedule for execution.<\/p>\n<p>After all key factors are well defined the crucial step is to develop appropriate automation framework. If you are using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/vs\/testing-tools\/\">Visual Studio tools<\/a>, you will find many projects templated and frameworks already build it and they are supporting various platforms.<\/p>\n<p>The last step of the process is to develop a <strong>Test script<\/strong> in order to define a set of instruction to be performed during the test execution.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6730\" title=\"2-Planning and executing Automated Tests\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/2-Planning-and-executing-Automated-Tests-1.jpg\" alt=\"2-Planning and executing Automated Tests\" width=\"763\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/2-Planning-and-executing-Automated-Tests-1.jpg 694w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/2-Planning-and-executing-Automated-Tests-1-300x179.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc473146209\"><\/a>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Automated testing<\/strong> is a good choice where tests should be performed frequently and quickly. Usage of Automated tests can save tons of money and time and furthermore, it highly increases the test coverage. Automated tests can be run unattended and they are flexible and maintainable.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s important to note that Automated tests should be created by a developer. Which is not the case in manual testing where the testing can be performed by tester without any programming skills.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important also to highlight that in some smaller projects. Where the testing is not so rapid, the development of <strong>Automated testing.<\/strong> can easily overweight the benefits against the cost, so in such cases. It\u2019s better to consider manual testing. Furthermore the Automated testing is in companionship with manual testing and it\u2019s not replacing it. It\u2019s considered to be a complement on top of manual testing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The key benefits of Automated testing are:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Running on multiple machines with different configuration;<\/li>\n<li>Obtaining Code coverage metrics in time when Automated tests are running;<\/li>\n<li>Helping to maintain stability;<\/li>\n<li>Execution of many different complex cases in every run, with coverage which is inaccessible in manual testing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Automated software testing Introduction Types of Automated testing UI Testing &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/07\/05\/automated-software-testing\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Automated software testing<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":6732,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[15,17,23,834],"tags":[60,70,877,151,205,876],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6725"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6725"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6725\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9594,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6725\/revisions\/9594"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6732"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6725"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6725"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6725"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
