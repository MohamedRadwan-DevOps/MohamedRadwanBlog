It\u2019s very important to know that it can help you to automate your deployments and to set up continues deployment. You can deploy regularly trough different production environments using managed workflows and even to multiple platforms.<\/p>\n<p>It can use <strong>manual or automated<\/strong>\u00a0steps for approval of workflows and have great impact on collaboration and transparency between teams. You can also have full trails history as it tracks the status of recent deployments in each of the environments.<br \/>\nThe control and security are another two important features, as you can selectively restrict which users can manage or just view release entities.<\/p>\n<p>Another great feature is to <strong>create your own workflows<\/strong>.

Step by step about all process, starting from creating the project, check in the code in the source control, create a build definition and trigger the build, and also create a release pipeline. Learn how to configure properly the build steps, including Copy Files and Publish Build Artifacts. See how to create new release definition, add environments and link to build definition.

The latter version is know now as\u00a0<strong>Visual Studio Team Services<\/strong> (before it was\u00a0<strong>Visual Studio Online <\/strong>or<strong> VSO<\/strong>). The cloud service is supported with\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Azure<\/a><\/strong>. It uses the same code as <strong>TFS<\/strong> on-premises and implements the most recent features. For\u00a0<strong>Visual Studio Team Services<\/strong> you don&#8217;t need any setup.\u00a0 You just need to sing in with Microsoft account to set up an environment and then you can start with creating projects and adding team members. All new developed features developed are added to the cloud version first and they \u00a0migrate approximately every three months\u00a0 to the on-premises version as updates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) vs Team Foundation Server (TFS)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/13\/release-management-overview-for-tfs-and-vsts\/2-vsts-vs-tfs-2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6416\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6416\" title=\"2-VSTS vs. TFS\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-VSTS-vs.-TFS-1.jpg\" alt=\"2-VSTS vs. TFS\" width=\"763\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-VSTS-vs.-TFS-1.jpg 776w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-VSTS-vs.-TFS-1-300x106.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-VSTS-vs.-TFS-1-768x270.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">\u00a0You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uGAcWLnSU0A\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">If you would like to find more information about how to get started with Release Management and its advantages. See how to create a build definition using CI\/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions. (I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks). And also using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI. All of that in order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will see how to create release definition, choose an artifact and configure source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different environments or clone the existing one. In my case I am going to create QA, Preproduction and Production environment. Each with one phrase and one task.
