Previously you would have to be on <strong>Mac<\/strong> to build <strong>iOS app<\/strong>. But now this is all possible with this cross-platforms in <strong>Visual Studio 2015<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> Read detailed explanation about all types of <strong>Scrum and Agile meetings<\/strong> (Sprint Planning, Stand-up, Grooming, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/scrum\/sprint-planning\">Sprint<\/a> Review, Retrospective Meeting) in my past post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/27\/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile\/\">Types of meetings in Scrum and Agile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"gray\"><span class=\"ion-video\">Video<\/span>You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zd6IgG1ifkY\">this video<\/a><\/strong>, if you would like to find more information about walkthrough about how to install Windows Server 2016 on a virtual machine.
