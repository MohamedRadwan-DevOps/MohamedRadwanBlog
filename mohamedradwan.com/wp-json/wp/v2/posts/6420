We will understand how the orchestration and clustering work for containers by managing the underline nodes which host the containers. We will understand also different technologies and services around container, like Docker, Docker Hub, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Azure Container Services (AKS), Azure Container Registry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Part 2\">Part 2: DevOps Practices<\/h3>\n<p>There are many fundamental <strong>DevOps practices<\/strong>. Few of them are listed below:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)<\/strong> is the practice in which the techniques, processes, and tool sets used in software development are leveraged to manage the deployment and configuration of systems, applications, and middleware. Most of the testing and deployment defects occur when developer\u2019s environments differ from testing and production environments. Putting these environments under version control yields immediate benefits in consistency, time savings, error rates, and auditability.<\/p>\n<p>Under <strong>Continuous Integration (CI) <\/strong>practice, the working copies of all the developers code are combined with a shared mainline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Automated Testing<\/strong> \u2013 is the practice where various tests such as load, functional, integration, and unit tests happen automatically either after you check in code (i.e. attached to CI) or some other means to fire off one or more tests automatically against a specific build or app.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/13\/release-management-overview-for-tfs-and-vsts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Release management<\/a><\/strong> is a practice intended to oversee the development, testing, deployment and support of software releases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Configuration Management<\/strong> is the practice for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product\u2019s performance with its requirements, design and operational information throughout its life.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/14\/devops-framework-and-practices\/2-devops-practices\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6422\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6422\" title=\"2- DevOps Practices\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-DevOps-Practices.jpg\" alt=\"2- DevOps Practices\" width=\"763\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-DevOps-Practices.jpg 1371w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-DevOps-Practices-300x154.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-DevOps-Practices-768x393.jpg 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-DevOps-Practices-1024x524.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">\u00a0You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uGAcWLnSU0A\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">if you would like to find more information about how to get started with Release Management and its advantages. See how to create a build definition using CI\/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions. (I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks), and also using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI. All of that in order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will see how to create release definition. Choose an artifact and configure source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different environments or clone the existing one.
