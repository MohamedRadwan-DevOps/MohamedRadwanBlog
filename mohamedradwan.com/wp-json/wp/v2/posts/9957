Welcome to the community interview, we are here at Microsoft ignite the tour in London and I have here Mark Allen.<\/p>\n<p>Hello Mark! It\u2019s really good to have you here!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s good to be here. I come over from Ireland to be here.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s great! If you can give us an introduction about yourself, what you are doing? Where are you based?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually based in Ireland and what I do these days is, I help companies get their stuff into the cloud, their code and data into the cloud. I&#8217;ve actually been a developer for about 35 years, now and these days obviously it&#8217;s not just developments as you know DevOps, data and infrastructure and all that sort of stuff going on as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m working on a project where the UK has a census every 10 years and the next one is coming up next year. So, I\u2019m working with a company that has a product where they go out and collect information, but this is for small companies. So, this has always been an on-premises based thing, but they&#8217;ve got the contract to work on the UK census which obviously is covering the entire country. By law everybody has to return the form. So, they&#8217;ve got 40,000 people going out into the field and knocking on doors and things. So, what I\u2019m doing is to help that company, get all their stuff into the cloud, so they can scale it up to the size that it needs to be to drive the UK census, that\u2019s the sort of thing I do is to help people scale up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s great! Can you give us an introduction about the topics that you are presenting in this event?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are two topics I&#8217;m presenting tomorrow, the first one is about Cosmos DB. So, it really explains what a no SQL database is, how Cosmos DB fits into the landscape, why it&#8217;s such a good no SQL database and also all the explaining some of the nice little things that you can do with it, which you don\u2019t necessarily think about when you just think database.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The other one, I\u2019m talking about is called it&#8217;s a slightly clickbait title but, it&#8217;s called containers vs. Serverless. So, I\u2019m talking about Azure functions versus Azure Kubernetes Services, and how you can actually get Serverless stuff running in AKS. So, that you can get the best of both worlds.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, why do you think is important to understand containers vs. Serverless?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well basically, Serverless is a great new paradigm, it allows you to scale up in a way that you never could before, it&#8217;s great for small companies that might get large because you really only pay for the amount of stuff you are using but it automatically happens.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, you don&#8217;t have to keep switching sliders or provisioning more stuff. AKS is a little more traditional, containers are great. Because you can pretty much lift anything you want, and put it into a container and then run it anywhere be there on-premises or in the cloud or on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, Kubernetes has traditionally been more of an API driven thing, with a more static but what&#8217;s nice about it, is that Portability and that ability to run any code that you want. So, you know what I\u2019m trying to do, is to show how you can get the benefits of containers but also get the benefits of an event-driven Serverless scalable thing going.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, how do you see the future for the container and the Serverless? And what is the things that you expect?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>the main problem that people have at the moment with Kubernetes, it\u2019s heavyweight infrastructure, it&#8217;s not something that you can just easily walk into it, say ok, I&#8217;ve got some containers, I&#8217;ll just run them in Kubernetes, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff going on in there. it gets quite complex, you need people who understand this and can run the Ops, where I would expect to see it going as people are trying to sort of simplifying so, it becomes more of the sort of an underlying concern.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, in the same way, Serverless has essentially got rid of the fact that you are running on servers and you no longer need to care what servers are running on all maintain them, you just it&#8217;s you know essentially it handles all. Kubernetes is starting to go the same way where people are trying to build simpler layers on top of that. So, although it&#8217;s still running Kubernetes under the covers, something more understandable and more easily provision of always on top of it, you know that\u2019s certainly where Microsoft seems to be pushing things at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How do you see cloud computing in the past, present and in the future in terms of adoption and development?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is an interesting question! because back in the day, you know you&#8217;ve heard the phrase the clouds just somebody else&#8217;s computer and for a while, it was, when it was just infrastructure-as-a-service you know yeah this does start days of the cloud, people were really just saying okay, here&#8217;s my VM this thing, just put my VM run it in the cloud and essentially use the cloud as a data center.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, Azure came at it from a slightly different point of view, they started of with no VMs at all, it was all that is now App service. So, it was all platforms as services stuff. So, you would take your website and database and deploy it up and it would take in the handle again the underlying infrastructure for you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, gradually people are starting now, even the ones who\u2019ve been just thinking as an infrastructure thing, they\u2019re realizing the stuff you can do in the cloud, which makes their life easier, and gives you a lot more power and really starts to make use of the sort of huge elasticity, and the huge power that you can get out of the cloud. So, that\u2019s where people seem to be starting to head now, is to get rid of the VMS and move much more towards cloud-native services and to platform and to software as service running in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, that\u2019s where things are generally going is, we&#8217;re starting to drop the caring about what you&#8217;re running on, adjusting really get the code out there and get it running, get the data uploaded and you know, let the cloud handle things that you don&#8217;t want to have to handle.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, are you expecting more adoption?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh! Absolutely yes. every company is looking at moving to the cloud, there&#8217;s one or two that are still clinging on for dear life to their VMs, their data center in on-premises, some of the larger and more established and slower-moving companies, but even though legal companies now, are moving lock stock and barrel into the cloud, banks and you have started to cross the Rubicon.<\/p>\n<p>So, they&#8217;ve started one of them and you know jumped and said okay, we\u2019re moving to a cloud so all the other ones say\u2026\u2026..<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the rest of the answer and other questions\/answers, please watch the video<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Interview with Mark Allan an Azure Cloud Expert and a\u00a0Microsoft &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2020\/01\/28\/interview-with-mark-allan-during-microsoft-ignite-the-tour-in-london\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Interview with Mark Allan during Microsoft Ignite The Tour in London<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":9963,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[16,18,23,1044],"tags":[99,1048,223,1050,1049,1040,1045],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9957"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=9957"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9957\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9969,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9957\/revisions\/9969"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/9963"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9957"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=9957"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=9957"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
