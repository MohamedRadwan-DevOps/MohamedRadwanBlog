Clone a project to a local Git repository, create a simple web application, and finally how to configure the CD extension. Allowing you to create a Build definition, run that Build, trigger a Release and complete app deployment to the cloud. The process of making changes to the CD and DevOps pipeline is also demonstrated. As well as managing Build failures with the help of the described extension.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll explain the details of each level in the next blog post of this series.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Use Case Scenarios<\/strong> :<\/h3>\n<p>Which represents a list of user actions and system&#8217;s response to it.
