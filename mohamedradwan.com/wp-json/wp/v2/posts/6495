It is a help to get everything you need in one solution. with agile planning, source code control build test and automated release to have regular integration, testing, delivery and monitoring of your application. It supports all famous test frameworks, such as Junit, Selenium, Jasmine, xUnit and Mochat. So that you are able to test any of the project types along the way with the deployment.<\/p>\n<p>It also refers to how changes to an application are documented and tracked. As you are building software iteratively you are getting continuous feedback that is going to flow back into the development team and give you insights into what you can make better in the next iteration or bugs that you need to fix. New features that you might need to add. A much better way, a more accurate a clear way to think about ALM is to view it as having four-parts:<\/p>\n<p>1. Plan<br \/>\n2. Develop + Test<br \/>\n3. Release<br \/>\n4. Monitor + Learn<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/08\/01\/what-is-application-lifecycle-management-alm\/application-lifecycle-management\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6496\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6496\" title=\"Application Lifecycle Management\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Application-Lifecycle-Management.jpg\" alt=\"Application Lifecycle Management\" width=\"763\" height=\"390\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Application-Lifecycle-Management.jpg 640w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Application-Lifecycle-Management-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span> If you would like to know more about the best practices for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/devops\/\">DevOps<\/a>, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, you can have a look at the following post: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/12\/29\/develop-vsts-extension-and-configure-ci-continuous-integration-and-cd-continuous-delivery-pipeline\/\">Configure CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery Pipeline)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span>In order to ensure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/continuous-integration\/\"><strong>Continuous Integration<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n<p class=\"blue\">We need to use proper <strong>deploying strategy<\/strong>.

An organization must decide whether an app is worth creating. At some point a decision is made to approve the project. Development kicks off then and governance become project portfolio management. Once the app is deployed in most organizations it is subject to what\u2019s become known as application portfolio management. The process of keeping track of all of your apps making decisions about .Which ones get what resources for update and so on and ultimately for making the final decision when to pull the plug on this app. Governance, making decisions runs throughout the entire ALM cycle.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">You can see <strong><a href=\" https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qk91C1WbPRA&amp;t=60s\">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">If you would like to find more information about How run JavaScript Unit test written in Jasmine from Command Line using Grunt and PhantomJS, it includes, how to install Node.js with NPM (Node Package Manager), how to install Grunt CLI (Command Line Interface), how to install contrib-jasmine npm, how to create Node.js default configuration file (pacakges.json), how to create the first Gruntfile.js configuration file, how to set the configuration to run Jasmine inside Gruntfile.js, how to ignore node_modules from Git source control so it will be ready for build automation in further videos.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you would like to know more about this new developer service available on the <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/\">Azure<\/a> platform, you can have a look at the following post; <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/12\/more-about-azure-devtest-labs\/\">More about Azure DevTest Labs<\/a>.
