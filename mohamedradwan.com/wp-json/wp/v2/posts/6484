Step by step about all process, starting from creating the project. Check in the code in the source control, create a build definition and trigger the build. And also create a release pipeline. Learn how to configure properly the build steps, including Copy Files and Publish Build Artifacts. See how to create new release definition, add environments and link to build definition. Afterwards see how to add tasks to the release definition, like Windows Machine File Copy and configure it properly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc457168377\"><\/a>Part 1: Continuous Deployment DevOps Practice<\/h2>\n<p>Pushing to production new versions of software under development is called <strong>Continuous Deployment<\/strong>. In big organizations, software is deployed thousands of times each day. <strong>Continuous Delivery <\/strong>involves some manual steps as in this practice the software is always release-ready, yet it is to be decided by the business personnel the timing of when to push it into production and so the final deployment is a <strong>manual step<\/strong>. On the other hand, everything is <strong>automatic<\/strong> with <strong>Continuous Deployment<\/strong>. Any updated working version of the application is automatically pushed to production. <strong>Continuous Deployment<\/strong> mandates <strong>Continuous Delivery<\/strong>, but the opposite is not required.<\/p>\n<p>In both cases <strong>agility<\/strong> is of the greatest importance, but <strong>continuous delivery<\/strong> allows businesses to manually decide when changes are implemented to applications and services.\u00a0 An ideal world, <strong>continuous deployment<\/strong> would be adopted by majority of companies. But sometimes due to some constraints this is not possible. And some scenarios the IT department must wait before a feature goes live.

See how to create a build definition using CI\/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions. (I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks), and also using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI. all of that in order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will see how to create release definition. Choose an artifact and configure source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different environments or clone the existing one. In my case I am going to create QA, Preproduction and Production environment. Each with one phrase and one task.

Using <strong>Release Management<\/strong>, we can either <strong>fully automate<\/strong> or <strong>semi-automate<\/strong> the delivery of our software.
