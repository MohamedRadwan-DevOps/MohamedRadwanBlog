There are some issues with doing Dev and Test environments on premises: it can take a long time to get an infrastructure, the cost is significant, and so is the time and effort in creating a production-like environment. A lot of organizations are moving towards the <strong>cloud<\/strong> for Dev &amp; Test environments; this is because the environment can be procured quickly, it has a lower cost, can be scaled as necessary, and the developers can start working directly with the production-like environment.<br \/>\nTo do this with <strong>Azure.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Microsoft provides <strong>Azure DevTest Labs<\/strong>. The lab is actually an additional construct in Azure, where particular Azure features can be subset for the Dev and Test teams to work in. Azure\u2019s services can be selected based on exactly what the client and project requires, <strong>templates<\/strong> can be created and reused, and <strong>quotas<\/strong> and <strong>policies<\/strong> can be set for the lab. Azure DevTest Labs was offered as a beta-trial for users in late 2015, and is now openly available for usage as both a free trial and as a paid service. Like with Azure\u2019s standard service, <strong>containers<\/strong> are supported in DevTest Labs as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> Read about basic guidelines that you need to consider when building a <strong>product backlog<\/strong> in the following post, <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/12\/05\/requirements-epic-feature-user-story-task-size-and-estimation-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Requirements (Epic, Feature, User Story), Task Size and Estimation in Agile and Scrum<\/a>, and also about its maintaining and refinement of product backlog in <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/30\/key-tips-for-maintaining-good-product-backlog-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Key tips for Maintaining good product backlog in Agile and Scrum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>In one of the old posts <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/07\/16\/tfs-2015-agile-project-management\/\">TFS 2015 Agile Project Management<\/a> you can read more about new <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/backlogs\/overview\"><strong>Agile Project Management<\/strong><\/a> features in <strong>TFS 2015, <\/strong>which provide better support for aligning across teams, while giving autonomy to individual teams; you can use the same structure with VSTS\/TFS2018.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"VM Selection\">Selecting a VM<\/h3>\n<p>From the main lab panel, you can directly select a <strong>virtual machine (VM)<\/strong> that you would like to work with.

In the quota settings, you can set a monthly budget, the maximum amount of VMs per user, and the maximum allowable VMs for the lab.<br \/>\nFor the budget, there is a <strong>usage chart<\/strong> that displays how much has already been spent, when it was spent, how much of the budget is remaining, and a projected out-of-budget date based on the usage history.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/12\/more-about-azure-devtest-labs\/1-virtual-machine-usage-chart-in-azure-devtest-labs\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6396\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6396 size-full\" title=\"1-Virtual Machine Usage Chart in Azure DevTest Labs\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/1-Virtual-Machine-Usage-Chart-in-Azure-DevTest-Labs.jpg\" alt=\"1-Virtual Machine Usage Chart in Azure DevTest Labs\" width=\"688\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/1-Virtual-Machine-Usage-Chart-in-Azure-DevTest-Labs.jpg 688w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/1-Virtual-Machine-Usage-Chart-in-Azure-DevTest-Labs-300x176.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you are in a situation when you need to integrate two backlogs, read the step-by-step post about <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/10\/21\/trello-vsts-integration\/\">Two Backlog Integration<\/a> in which I am providing a detailed description of the integration between <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\"><strong>Trello<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/\"><strong>VSTS<\/strong><\/a> using <a href=\"https:\/\/zapier.com\/\">Zapier<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"gray\">You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I9OAqrAuJT4 \">this video<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"gray\">if you would like to find more information about the new tools and enhancements for Continuous Delivery.

Create a new team project on VSTS or connect to an existing project. Clone a project to a local Git repository, create a simple web application. And finally how to configure the CD extension. Allowing you to create a Build definition, run that Build, trigger a Release and complete app deployment to the cloud. The process of making changes to the CD and DevOps pipeline is also demonstrated. As well as managing Build failures with the help of the described extension.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the maximum allowable VMs per team member. It can be set as a general limit or can be tailored to individual team members. This is helpful when some team members require significantly more VMs than others because of their role. Such as a team member running performance tests. The team total is also an important moderation measure for efficiency and cost. Regardless of how many VMs an individual role may require. This should be calculated to be equivalent to the maximum amount of VMs per each person. But each lab should consider their own circumstances and set it up accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In settings tab, you can modify next parameters:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Monthly budget that you plan to spent.<\/li>\n<li>The max number of VM&#8217;s per User.<\/li>\n<li>The max number of VM&#8217;s per User.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/12\/more-about-azure-devtest-labs\/2-azure-devtest-labs-quota\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6397\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6397 size-full\" title=\"2-Azure DevTest Labs Quota\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-Azure-DevTest-Labs-Quota.jpg\" alt=\"2-Azure DevTest Labs Quota\" width=\"397\" height=\"374\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-Azure-DevTest-Labs-Quota.jpg 397w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-Azure-DevTest-Labs-Quota-300x283.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAs an admin of the lab, you can also set which <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/virtual-machines-windows-sizes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VM sizes<\/a> can be used by the team when they\u2019re setting up their VMs.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Creating VM\">Creating VMs<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to create your own VM rather than using one of the available ones that are already set up.
