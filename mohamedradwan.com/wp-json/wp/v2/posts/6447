In order to provide a road map for how to implement <strong>new<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong> <strong>different\u00a0technologies along with the process\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0and provide <strong>learning<\/strong> perspectives. A few of the project roles include web design, web development, desktop development.

To provide <strong>learning materials<\/strong>, outputs such as videos and step-by-step materials will be produced throughout the project. One of the ultimate goals of the Codeflyers project is to provide <strong>comprehensive training<\/strong> that covers all primary and alternative scenarios for realistic situations that may be encountered.

Product Backlog Items (<strong>PBIs<\/strong>) on the backlog are tasks to complete on the e-commerce platform\/website. Such as implementing search filters or updating an offer for a product. PBIs are comprised of smaller individual <strong>tasks.<\/strong> Such as developing a section of code that contributes towards achieving the overall output of a given PBI. Above PBIs in the organizational hierarchy is Features; <strong>Features<\/strong> are a collection of PBIs that contribute towards a facet of the project. At the top of the hierarchy is <strong>Epics<\/strong>, which are a collection of Features.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6444\" title=\"Codeflyers PBI Backlog\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Codeflyers-Backlog-1.png\" alt=\"Codeflyers PBI Backlog\" width=\"763\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Codeflyers-Backlog-1.png 1606w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Codeflyers-Backlog-1-300x140.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Codeflyers-Backlog-1-768x359.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Codeflyers-Backlog-1-1024x479.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you are in a situation when you need to integrate two backlogs, read the step-by-step post about <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/10\/21\/trello-vsts-integration\/\">Two Backlog Integration<\/a> in which I am providing a detailed description of the integration between <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\"><strong>Trello<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/team-services\/\"><strong>VSTS<\/strong><\/a> using <a href=\"https:\/\/zapier.com\/\">Zapier<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/marketplace.visualstudio.com\/vsts\"><strong>VSTS extensions<\/strong><\/a> designed to make the work process easier.

To do this, Codeflyers has placed a time expectation based on the level of the contribution. Individual <strong>tasks<\/strong> should be measured in hours<strong>.PBIs<\/strong> should be measured in days<strong>.Features<\/strong> should be measured in weeks, and <strong>Epics<\/strong> should be measured in months. Likewise to keep the project manageable and running smoothly. An average of tasks should be maintained to keep the project from being overwhelming. Each Feature should have between 3 and 5 PBIs, and each Epic should contain between 3 and 5 Features.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Codeflyers<\/strong> is a community project designed to teach practical skills for various roles in a software team. And provide opportunities to apply the knowledge in a practical setting. The layout of the project has made it simple to begin working on it and manageable. So that it will not become overwhelming initially or as time goes on. Codeflyers will be an ongoing project, regularly creating new content for training and continuously creating new projects as each finishes.
