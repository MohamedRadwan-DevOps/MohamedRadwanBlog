These are the real MVPs<\/p>\n<p>But they will never give you even\u00a0a look if you just work for the badge and they will know that.<\/p>\n<p>For me, becoming an MVP gives me the opportunity to be an insider and have closed\u00a0communication with the product team and this will help me to enhance <strong>my\u00a0knowledge<\/strong>, <strong>the community<\/strong> and <strong>the\u00a0Visual Studio\u00a0<\/strong>and this is exactly what I really want.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you only work to get the badge, you will never get it and if you could, you will lose it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nSo just work to make the community better for you and for me and you will get it with all our respect and support&#8230;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mohamed Radwan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Visual Studio ALM MVP.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most asked questions in the Microsoft technology communities about &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2012\/10\/08\/why-do-you-want-to-be-an-mvp\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Why do you want to be an MVP???<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[16,32],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2777"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2777"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2777\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6021,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2777\/revisions\/6021"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2777"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2777"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2777"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
