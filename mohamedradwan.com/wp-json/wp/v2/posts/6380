Because upgrade to <strong>Update 3<\/strong> needs to be done from <strong>TFS 2010 or later release<\/strong>. If you are using <strong>TFS 2015 RTM<\/strong> you can directly upgrade to <strong>Update 3<\/strong> or you can even upgrade from <strong>TFS 2010 SP1<\/strong> . And later directly to <strong>Update 3<\/strong>. So upgrade is possible from a pre-release to a later build from same release.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Supported server operating systems:<\/strong><br \/>\nWindows Server 2012 R2 (Essentials, Standard, Datacenter), Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 (minimum SP1) (Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Supported client operating systems:<\/strong><br \/>\nWindows 10 (Home, Professional, Enterprise), Windows 8.1 (Basic, Professional, Enterprise), Windows 8, Windows 7 (minimum SP1) (Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, Ultimate).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Hardware requirements:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>2.13 GHz or faster processor, 1 GB or greater RAM, 8 GB or more available hard disk space.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start with the upgrade, it\u2019s highly recommendable to ensure that you have a complete and consistent set of database backups and to do a dry run on existing hardware in a pre-production environment.<\/p>\n<p>After the upgrade is done, there is a possibility that you will need to configure some of the new features. If you don\u2019t do that immediately, those features just won\u2019t be available in specific team project, until you configure them.<\/p>\n<p>In the time that upgrade will be implemented, Your <strong>TFS deployment<\/strong> will be offline for the duration of that upgrade. The duration deepens on many factors, mostly of the deployment size. For upgrade of very large databases to <strong>TFS 2015<\/strong>, the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/docs\/setup-admin\/upgrade-tfs\/pre-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TfsPreUpgrade tool<\/a><\/strong> is available, which will in the time of upgrade allow you to continue with using <strong>TFS<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"gray\"><span class=\"ion-video\">Video<\/span>You can see <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wRG6acZX4Js\">this video<\/a><\/strong>, if you would like to find more information about How to stop the SharePoint services on a SharePoint machine and how to stop the IIS via the Command Line (cmd), we will open services using run then stop SharePoint Administration, SharePoint Search Host Controller, SharePoint Server Search, SharePoint Timer Services, SharePoint Tracing Service, SharePoint User Code Host, SharePoint VSS Writer; then we run command line as administrator the use iisreset \/stop.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you are interested in developing a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/extend\/overview\">Visual Studio Team Service extension<\/a>, and you would like to know and to follow the best practices for DevOps, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, &#8211; have a look at the following post, <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/12\/29\/develop-vsts-extension-and-configure-ci-continuous-integration-and-cd-continuous-delivery-pipeline\/\">Develop VSTS Extension and Configure CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery Pipeline)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Con\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><strong>TFS<\/strong> is a right choice when you need your data to stay within your network or you want access.\u00a0 To <strong>SharePoint<\/strong> sites and reporting services that integrate with <strong>TFS<\/strong> data and tools.
