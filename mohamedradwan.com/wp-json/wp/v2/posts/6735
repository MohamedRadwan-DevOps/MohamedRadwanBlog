Most of my experiences come from <strong>Software Development<\/strong>, so I\u2019ll be mostly referring to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agile_software_development\"><strong>Agile<\/strong> in <strong>Software Development<\/strong><\/a>. Although, I do believe in <strong>Agile<\/strong> methodologies so much, that I implement them in all areas of my life, professional and private. For me <strong>Agile<\/strong> isn\u2019t only a set of methodologies and practices, it\u2019s a mindset and way of thinking and acting in real everyday situations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>Read detailed explanation about all types of <strong>Scrum and Agile meetings<\/strong> (Sprint Planning, Stand-up, Grooming, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/scrum\/sprint-planning\">Sprint<\/a> Review, Retrospective Meeting) in my past post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/27\/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile\/\">Types of meetings in Scrum and Agile<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So, let me first explain how the <strong>Agile<\/strong> was started. In 2001 a small group of software developers got together to discuss how to manage <strong>Software Development<\/strong> project in more efficient and better way. So, they produced the <a href=\"http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/principles.html\"><strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Manifesto<\/strong><\/a>, which is representing 4 important values:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6736\" title=\"AgileManifesto-Values\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/AgileManifesto-Values.jpg\" alt=\"AgileManifesto-Values\" width=\"762\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/AgileManifesto-Values.jpg 639w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/AgileManifesto-Values-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> Read about basic guidelines that you need to consider when building a <strong>product backlog<\/strong> in the following post, <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/12\/05\/requirements-epic-feature-user-story-task-size-and-estimation-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Requirements (Epic, Feature, User Story), Task Size and Estimation in Agile and Scrum<\/a>, and also about its maintaining and refinement of product backlog in <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/30\/key-tips-for-maintaining-good-product-backlog-in-agile-and-scrum\/\">Key tips for Maintaining good product backlog in Agile and Scrum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Methods<\/strong> follow <a href=\"http:\/\/agilemanifesto.org\/principles.html\">12 principles<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>In a way to have good collaboration with customer and even inside the team. The communication inside the organization and team is a very important point. The team should be highly motivated all the time and they should have the work environment that stimulates such actions. On the other hand, to maintain customer satisfaction on a high level, the continuous collaboration with a customer is required.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Methods<\/strong> focus on responsiveness and adoption to changes and continuous development and delivery. In <strong>Agile<\/strong> we fail fast and don\u2019t just blindly follow the plan. At highest we target the customer satisfaction trough early and continuous delivery of software. Even behind Failing fast there is a philosophy that aims to comprehensive testing and incremental <strong>Software Development !<\/strong> to understand if our project has enough of value. The main idea of this philosophy is to avoid losses and risks in cases when testing shows that our project or part of a project isn\u2019t\u2019 working well. In such cases we can adapt quickly to necessary changes and try new options.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc473223198\"><\/a>Agile in Software Development<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Software Development<\/strong>, <strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Methods<\/strong> are constantly being refurbished and improved along the way. By my opinion following <strong>Agile<\/strong> in <strong>Software Development.<\/strong> It\u2019s a must, as usually systems require frequent changes during the development process. Trough last years the <strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Software Development<\/strong> approach is becoming more and more recognized and accepted by different organizations, individuals, and companies. The main goal of its usage is to achieve the best quality and timeline of the project and to deploy the best possible solutions for the customer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip <\/span>If you want to know more about maintaining the backlog in a proper way.

They are so quick that is not recommendable only to follow and to adapt to changes. It\u2019s necessary if the organization or individual wants to keep up-to-date. \u00a0In order to survive in this world of constant and quick changes and development.\u00a0 The adoption of changes should be flexible and highly responsive. So the core target in <strong>Software Development<\/strong> is having rapid and continuous development. With great collaboration between teams and customer and with high-quality simultaneous releases.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Software Development<\/strong>, we relate to 5 factors to reach success: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/10\/31\/devops-the-three-stage-conversation-people-process-products\/\">Organizational, People, Process, Project, and Technical.<\/a> Of course, for every factor, there is a philosophy and other subsets.<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc473223199\"><\/a><strong>Agile Methods<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There is a wide range of <strong>Agile<\/strong> <strong>Methods<\/strong> used in software development life cycle (SDLC). Some of them concentrate on workflow and others on practices. Two most familiar <strong>Methods<\/strong> focusing on workflow are <strong>Scrum<\/strong> and <strong>Kanban<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scrum<\/strong> is an Agile\u2019s framework used for project management. It focuses on building a product which will meet the requirements. In <strong>Scrum<\/strong>, the iterations are divided in short intonation, known as Sprints, which are usually long from one to three weeks. Inside the Sprint the product is being integrated and possibly ready to ship. It\u2019s being tested at all time and at the end of the Sprint, the product is revised by the team to see if it meets the requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Also at this meet-up at the end of the Sprint, the team plans next sprint and steps. \u00a0In <strong>Scrum<\/strong>, there are 3 important roles: <strong>Product Owner<\/strong>, <strong>Scrum<\/strong> <strong>Master<\/strong>, and <strong>Team Members<\/strong>. The <strong>Product Owner<\/strong> is a role with vision and authority to take the decision. <strong>Scrum<\/strong> <strong>Master\u2019s<\/strong> role is to coordinate the project between <strong>Product Owner<\/strong> and the team, but he doesn\u2019t manage the team as the team is self-managed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kanban<\/strong> is a framework which focuses on Work visualization, workflow, and Continuous Improvement. <strong>Kanban<\/strong> board are used for the team to visualize the work and to optimize the work as much as possible. It enables much easier collaboration inside the team and between teams, it supports traceability and it can be usually accessed from various locations.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6738\" title=\"Kanban-Board-Agile\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Kanban-Board-Agile.jpg\" alt=\"Kanban-Board-Agile\" width=\"763\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Kanban-Board-Agile.jpg 978w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Kanban-Board-Agile-300x167.jpg 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Kanban-Board-Agile-768x426.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> The post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/09\/18\/user-stories-in-agile-world\/\">User stories in Agile world <\/a> focuses on an important unit of Agile software development process, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/work-items\/guidance\/agile-process-workflow\">User Story<\/a>.

But in this post, I\u2019ve just summarized main principles and philosophies standing behind <strong>Agile.<\/strong> Just to have a quick understanding what <strong>Agile<\/strong> is about. <strong>Agile<\/strong> is about small steps in development with incremental releases and iterations. Focusing on frequent deliveries and quick adoption to changes. With transparency.
