This doesn\u2019t mean that we should refine every single<a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/07\/05\/how-to-add-custom-fields-to-existing-work-items\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong> work item<\/strong><\/a> in the backlog, but we should focus to have finely groomed work items, that will be sufficient always for next two coming sprints.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So as the timing to deliver work items is getting closed. We should be more certain that the top work items are going to be delivered soon. In that time, we would definitely want to understand the requirements better. With a higher level of details of what is actually expected from the work or delivery perspective.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is a great opportunity to get inside the head of <strong>Product Owner.<\/strong> And ask the questions in order to understand <strong>requirements<\/strong> in a detailed way. That will help the team to deliver expected result.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc499086242\"><\/a>Backlog refinement through time<\/h2>\n<p>In the image below, you will see that at the end of <strong>Backlog<\/strong> there are work items, which will be probably divided in later <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/11\/27\/types-of-meetings-in-scrum-and-agile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>grooming sessions<\/strong> <\/a>into smaller work items. During our development, we\u2019ll be adding new work items or removing existing ones, if they become obsolete. The more we\u2019ll be approaching to the work items with higher priority, the more detailed and refined they will be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/itemContent.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7723\" title=\"Backlog_Refinement\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/itemContent.png\" alt=\"Backlog_Refinement\" width=\"754\" height=\"732\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/itemContent.png 488w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/itemContent-300x291.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This means that the work items with higher priority will capture requirements in more details.

Refining the requirements has a significant meaning for delivering working piece of product or service and this refinement is usually done in the stages when development of this items is getting closer to actual beginning of the work or of development. In Scrum we usually use some successful techniques for defining the requirement&#8217;s size and content. I will explain more in details about requirements size and estimations in my next post.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"green\"><span class=\"ion-info\">More Info<\/span>The post <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2017\/09\/18\/user-stories-in-agile-world\/\">User stories in Agile world <\/a> focuses on an important unit of Agile software development process, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/vsts\/work\/work-items\/guidance\/agile-process-workflow\">User Story<\/a>.
