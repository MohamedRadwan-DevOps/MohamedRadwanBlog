Containers VS. Hyper-V Container. You will learn what is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.docker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Docker<\/a>, Value Preposition for VM VS.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Containers, how to install and uninstall Docker on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linux.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Linux<\/a> and Windows. You will also learn the difference between Images VS. Containers, Container Deployment Workflow and container registry, Dockerfile and how to enable Bridge Networking and Port Mapping in Docker image. In the end, we will see the relation between Containers, CI\/CD and DevOps to understand where does container fits in the DevOps space.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>docker for beginners step-by-step guide<br \/>\nIn this post and video, you are going to get an overview of containers concept and how to install docker, uninstall and many other things.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, the first I will list all the commands that I will use during the demo so it will be very easy for you if you want to copy and paste these commands.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You are going to see the difference between virtual machines, containers and hyper-v container which used by Microsoft in the Windows platform then, we will start understanding what is the docker and the value proposition of VM vs containers then we will understand the difference between images and containers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are going to talk about container deployment workflow which is very important to understand all the complete lifecycle creating the image, storing the image, pull and push the image and how to make a snapshot of the container and many others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Then we will introduce the docker file which is the way that we work with docker in a silent mode using docker.<\/p>\n<p>After that, we will go to see the port mapping and how to expose port from the container on the hosted machine or the hosted node.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After that, we are going to cover the container and CI CD or continuous integration continuous deployment or delivery pipeline and what is the relation between them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After that, we will see the demo on how to install docker, how to uninstall and then how to update the packages, edit the package source file and running container, download image or pulling image and many other different commands.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s see the difference between containers and virtual machine and hyper-v container.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual machine created and managed by hypervisors, such as VirtualBox, hyper-v or even VMware and this machine running on a host operating system which could be the same but it required a complete a separate operating system.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The main reason behind that, this will give a high-level degree of isolation but on the other side, the cost for that is long time to start up, not effective portability for example if we want to move a virtual machine just imagine one virtual machine could maybe have like 120 gigabytes and move them over the network or between pcs it&#8217;s not very effective, a high memory requirements as well.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>but when we look to containers, we will find that containers leverage the operating system that is already in place to offer much separation so, for example, RAM requirements are lower the operating system is not duplicated because it used the same kernel of the hosting operating system the size is less so moving over the network or between PCs become easier and the coast also become easier because in one virtual machine for example when I be on the cloud or virtual machine.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip (<strong><a href=\" https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2019\/06\/08\/getting-started-with-kubernetes-cluster-ci-cd-for-azure-kubernetes-service\/ \"> Kubernetes cluster for beginner <\/a>)<\/strong><\/span> For more information about how to work with Kubernetes cluster and deploy it to <strong>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) <\/strong>and work with <strong>Azure Container Registry<\/strong>, see <strong><a href=\" https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2019\/06\/08\/getting-started-with-kubernetes-cluster-ci-cd-for-azure-kubernetes-service\/ \">Kubernetes cluster for beginner<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Commands<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>docker<\/li>\n<li>apt install docker.io<\/li>\n<li>sudo bash<\/li>\n<li>exit<\/li>\n<li>sudo nano \/etc\/apt\/sources.list<\/li>\n<li>sudo apt update<\/li>\n<li>sudo apt install docker.io<\/li>\n<li>sudo apt remove docker.io<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker pull nginx<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker images<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker ps<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker run nginx<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker stop yourContaier ID<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker pull tutum\/hello-world<\/li>\n<li>sudo docker run -p 8080:80 tutum\/hello-world<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2019\/03\/04\/building-and-deploying-your-code-with-azure-pipelines\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Docker For Beginners Step-by-Step Tutorial &nbsp;
