This release follows the most popular GitHub Enterprise Server release in years. GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 brought GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages and GitHub Advanced Security to companies self-hosting GitHub for the first time. Since then, as a response to customers\u2019 feedback there has been an improvement in stability and ease of use across the platform. With GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1, all of those changes are incorporated alongside a host of new features &#8211; from Actions to pull requests &#8211; to help teams take ideas from code to production in less time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This release includes:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub Actions workflow visualizations: track and troubleshoot complex workflows at a glance<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auto-merge pull requests: automatically merge a pull request the moment it\u2019s ready<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repository performance optimization: for large, busy repositories<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub Actions: Workflow visualizations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With workflow visualizations we can view and understand complex workflows, track progress of workflows in near real time, troubleshoot runs quickly by e<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asily accessing logs and job metadata and monitor progress deployment jobs and easily access deployment targets. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub Actions will now create a simple, visual graph of every workflow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auto-merge pull requests: automatically merge a pull request the moment it\u2019s ready<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s say that we have a project that is built for Android, iOS and web, and each of those platforms have their own test suite. If the tests are successful then we have a release step as well. We have already started a pull request. Here we can use autocomplete, which works for numbered lists and unnumbered lists as well. Next, instead of having to wait for tests to run, or for the review to come back, we can go to the bottom of the pull request and enable the option auto-merge, shown on Image 1.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10349\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10349\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-10349\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-1-Enable-auto-merge-1024x590.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-1-Enable-auto-merge-1024x590.png 1024w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-1-Enable-auto-merge-300x173.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-1-Enable-auto-merge-768x443.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-1-Enable-auto-merge.png 1379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10349\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 1 &#8211; Enable auto-merge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next we can create our commit message and hit Confirm auto-merge, shown on image 2. After this, the pull request will be automatically merged when all the tests are passed and when all the required reviews have been submitted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10348\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10348\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-10348\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-2-Confirm-auto-merge-1024x345.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-2-Confirm-auto-merge-1024x345.png 1024w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-2-Confirm-auto-merge-300x101.png 300w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-2-Confirm-auto-merge-768x259.png 768w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-2-Confirm-auto-merge.png 1279w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10348\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 2 &#8211; Confirm auto-merge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next improvement that we are going to mention in this post is custom notifications. Before in the notifications settings, we could only watch the participating option, all activity and ignore. Now we can see one more option displayed last in the list, it is the option Custom. When choosing this option, we can choose to receive notifications for issues, pull requests, releases or all three(shown on Image 3).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10350\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10350\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-10350\" src=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-3-Custom-notifications.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-3-Custom-notifications.png 665w, https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Image-3-Custom-notifications-300x238.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10350\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image 3 &#8211; Custom notifications<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repository performance optimization: for large, busy repositories<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this release, repository performance for large mono repos has been optimized. Git right operations are now performed up to 30 times faster. When we push to a repository a checksum is computed in order to ensure repositories remain in sync. During repair operations, sometimes those checksums are computed from scratch and sometimes it can take up to 30 seconds for large amounts of repos. Starting with 3.1 GitHub enterprise server now computes this replica check sums prior to taking the lock to be always under one second, allowing more right operations to succeed immediately.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Security features<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secret scanning is a lightning fast engine that detects credentials in our code when they are pushed to GitHub. This feature now will be available for all GitHub advanced security customers. It scans for credentials using a broad set of patterns, including those from over 35 different partners. Additionally, repository admins on enterprise servers will not be notified immediately whenever a secret is committed to their code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Secret scanning, there is also Code scanning. CodeQL engine can now detect more sources of untrusted user data with new or improved support for 20 libraries and frameworks across C++, Java, Python, JavaScript.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also two new features in enterprise server 3.2 and beyond. First one is the long-awaited dark mode for developers that prefer to code at night or just prefer the deeper contrast for when they work. Second feature is verify domains, which will allow enterprise server admins to restrict what domains email notifications can go to, so they can make sure that their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">code stays even more secure within their enterprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1, read the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/enterprise-server@3.1\/admin\/release-notes#3.1.0.rc1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub Enterprise Server 3.1 release notes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/enterprise.github.com\/releases\/3.1.0\/download\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">download<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it now.
