It\u2019s opposed to \u201chow\u201d we should implement the requirements. <strong>Scrum is a framework<\/strong>, where there is a space for different tactics. Which can be fitted into the context and individual case. You can think in the way that <strong>Scrum<\/strong> is taking the best practices and scales them in the best way to fit into individual organization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scrum<\/strong> is supporting very simple, but yet very effective ideas.\u00a0 Which are embracing teams to regularly check in what they are doing. So that they can make sure they are heading in the right direction and that they are building something that people actually want. Along with checking if the output is heading into the right direction. <strong>Scrum<\/strong> also encourage teams to find the ways how they can improve not only the product or the service that they are building. But also themselves, by asking themselves how they could do something better and faster. What this basically means is that every little while, the team will stop and inspect what they are doing and how they might do it better. This is referred in <strong>Scrum<\/strong> as <strong>Inspect and Adapt cycle<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span>You can find more information about <strong>DevOps<\/strong> in the following post: <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2016\/10\/31\/devops-the-three-stage-conversation-people-process-products\/\">DevOps: The Three Stage Conversation &#8211; People, Process, Products<\/a> which describes the basic principles of <strong>DevOps<\/strong>.
