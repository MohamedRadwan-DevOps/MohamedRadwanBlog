The tool developed in .NET Core, so it\u2019s cross platform, it used Work-item REST API. So it\u2019s a great example for how to consume that API, in this video. I am going to explain in step by step, how to migrate work-items using this tools. That we will see how to change the configuration to include the source and target projects and use VSTS access token. We will see also some tricks about how to use the tool.<\/p>\n<p>It will see how run the validation with dotnet WiMigrator.dll -v configuration.json command and how to run the real migration with dotnet WiMigrator.dll -m configuration.json command<br \/>\nWe just\u00a0 see how to remove GUID tag to re-run the migration again and many others.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"blue\"><span class=\"ion-tip\">Tip<\/span> If you would like to learn more about different tools and ways for Team Foundation Server to Visual Studio Team Services migration, &#8211; have a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2018\/03\/11\/published-a-quick-guide-about-real-stories-for-migrating-team-foundation-server-to-visual-studio-team-services\/\">quick guide about real stories for migrating Team Foundation Server to Visual Studio Team Services<\/a>.

Going through all six phases of the migration, following the migration guide provided by Microsoft as a walkthrough. You will see how to get started with the migration process and which prerequisites should be completed. The most important prerequisite is that you must have Azure Active Directory in order to use TFS Migrator tool. See more about the two different process models supported by VSTS, Inherited and Hosted XML. See which decisions you should make and how to validate them. For example which customizations you should keep and which one to remove. To prepare the first collection dacpac, first you should prepare Azure Storage Container, create dacpac file and afterwards upload it. To prepare the second collection Azure VM, you should install SQL Server. Backup the DB from the collection and upload it to the Azure storage container. See first how to import (dry &#8211; run) and how to change the configuration afterwards in order to import (production).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft released new tool vsts-work-item-migrator.
