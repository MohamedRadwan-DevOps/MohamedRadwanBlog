Like adding more layers to the base image. push that to container images registry on the cloud. Then pull that from the registry to anywhere to have a new container. Then it will understand how the orchestration and clustering work for containers by managing the underline nodes which host the containers. That will understand also different technologies and services around container. Like Docker, Docker Hub, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Azure Container Services (AKS), Azure Container Registry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first section at the top will be your menu bar, then on the extreme left hand side you have got the view bar. Next to the view bar you have got the side bar and the big area in the centre is where you have your editor and at the bottom there is a status bar.<\/p>\n<h3>On the <strong>menu bar<\/strong> you have got a file menu.<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>file menu<\/strong> will give you access to various file related functions so you can open files\/folders. save files, close editor\/folders etc.<\/p>\n<p>The edit menu will give you access to various basic editing functions such as undo. Redo, cut, copy, paste and also the find and replace functions.<\/p>\n<p>On the <strong>view menu<\/strong> you can access and also toggle various of the user interface related components. So you can switch between various areas of the view bar.<\/p>\n<p>The go to menu allows you to do basic navigation in your code so you can navigate forward, backward. Access the navigation history as well as go to specific file, symbol, definition or a line number.<\/p>\n<h4>The <strong>help menu<\/strong> gives you access to the documentation and release notes and also check for updates.<\/h4>\n<p>The <strong>view bar<\/strong> on the left hand side works in conjunction with the side bar. As you navigate between these various functional areas, you will also change the view of the sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>On the <strong>status bar<\/strong> you will be able to access various extension related functions. You will also see icons related to <a href=\"https:\/\/git-scm.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Git support<\/strong><\/a> so from here you can perform functionalities such as switching between branches and you can also synchronize changes in your local repository with your remote repository.<\/p>\n<p>Next to that there are <strong>errors<\/strong> and <strong>warnings .<\/strong> And that\u2019s going to be dependent on the type of project that you are editing . So if there are errors and warnings. You will be able to see those down here.<\/p>\n<p>On the right hand side of the status bar, it shows <strong>current line number<\/strong> and <strong>column<\/strong>. It shows to us that we are using spaces or tabs and the number of spaces. It will show the encoding of the current file and then also it will allow us to set the end of line sequence.<\/p>\n<p>Smiley face allows you to tweet feedback to the visual studio code team.
