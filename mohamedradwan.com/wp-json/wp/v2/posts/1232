Reason: No such host is known. Make sure the test controller is online and the firewall on the test controller is not blocking the connection<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0happened\u00a0because the Test Agent can&#8217;t resolve the Test controller machine name, I try many solution, like adding the Test controller machine IP with name in the host file, but no matter what the IP resolved it&#8217;s\u00a0different, we know that any\u00a0machine\u00a0that working in isolation\u00a0network\u00a0is will has 2 virtual network adapters one for private network and one for external network and everyone has it&#8217;s own DNS, so the \u00a0solution was just add the Test Controller\u00a0record\u00a0in the private Domain\u00a0LabAD (Active\u00a0Directory) in my case and everything working great.<\/p>\n<p>For any help, just contact me \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Network isolation on MSDN you can visit the following link<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"MSDN\" href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ee830480.aspx#NetworkIsolatedEnvironments\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/ee830480.aspx#NetworkIsolatedEnvironments<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this post I will describe how we can use &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2012\/03\/04\/using-notwork-isolation-in-lab-management-and-solve-some-issues\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Using Notwork isolation in Lab Management and solve some issues<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[16,17,37,38],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1232"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1232"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1232\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1232"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1232"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1232"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
