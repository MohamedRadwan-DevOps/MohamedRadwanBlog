Going through all six phases of the migration, following the migration guide provided by Microsoft as a walkthrough. You will see how to get started with the migration process and which prerequisites should be completed. The most important prerequisite is that you must have Azure Active Directory in order to use TFS Migrator tool. See more about the two different process models supported by VSTS, Inherited and Hosted XML. See which decisions you should make and how to validate them, for example which customizations you should keep and which one to remove. To prepare the first collection dacpac, first you should prepare Azure Storage Container, create dacpac file and afterwards upload it. To prepare the second collection Azure VM, you should install SQL Server, backup the DB from the collection and upload it to the Azure storage container. See first how to import (dry &#8211; run) and how to change the configuration afterwards in order to import (production).\n <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wrote in a previous post about how to migrate &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2015\/07\/15\/estimating-the-time-for-migrating-projects-to-vso-visual-studio-online\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Estimating the time for migrating projects to VSO (Visual Studio Online)<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":5498,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[16,17,43],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4952"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4952"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4952\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":8482,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4952\/revisions\/8482"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5498"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4952"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4952"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4952"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
