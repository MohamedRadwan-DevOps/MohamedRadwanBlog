\u00a0So how we can do this in no time&#8230;..????<\/p>\n<p>DevMagicFake can do this with one line of code, so we can start working and testing and make a real good design for our feature\u00a0as we already enter all these data even with any change happen every time<\/p>\n<p>Think of<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop\u00a0by feature<\/li>\n<li>Test Driven Development<\/li>\n<li>Test Driven Design<\/li>\n<li>I didn&#8217;t complete the whole database<\/li>\n<li>I always change my object model and\u00a0always\u00a0need to be existing data related to each\u00a0other\u00a0with the new\u00a0modification\u00a0of the object model classes I have made<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What is the solution??????<\/p>\n<p>DevMagicFake will help us do this with no effort at all.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Till now I didn&#8217;t get the\u00a0feedback\u00a0that I expected from publishing &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"ast-button\" href=\"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/2011\/11\/10\/did-you-really-need-devmagicfake\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Did you really need DevMagicFake ????<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[16,22],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1045"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1045"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1045\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1045"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1045"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedradwan.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1045"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
