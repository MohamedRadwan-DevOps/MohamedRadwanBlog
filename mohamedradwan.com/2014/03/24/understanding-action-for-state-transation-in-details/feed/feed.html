					<description><![CDATA[Great article, I just passed this onto a co-worker who was doing a little analysis on this. And he in fact bought me breakfast because I discovered it for him. :). So let me rephrase that: Thanks for the treat! But yeah Thanks for taking the time to talk about this, I feel strongly about it and love learning more on this topic. If possible, as you gain expertise, would you mind updating your blog with more details? It is very helpful for me. Two thumb up for this blog post!

Actually I don&#039;t have examples and I didn&#039;t use it in any project before, what I am trying here is to understand it so if I have a problem then I may think of it.

If you got some example, remember to share :-)]]></description>

I think that was what I was kind-of saying - as I am struggling to see when the right time and place is. Having read your blog article and some other threads elsewhere I came to the conclusion that custom Actions only apply to kicking off something external?

I could do with some examples of when you might use it? Do you know of any other material that may enlighten me?

I am literally just starting to read up on this - needing to implement a portion within the next 2 or 3 weeks! So, lots to get to grips with and try my best not to go in the wrong direction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great blog series (Understanding TFS Process Customization in Details- Series) so far - trying to understand how to customise, why I might customise and the consequences (possibly down the line, like an upgrade to TFS) of customising.

Actions seem like something I should ignore? (unless perhaps I am trying to trigger some non TFS activity - can&#039;t imagine what at the moment).]]></description>
