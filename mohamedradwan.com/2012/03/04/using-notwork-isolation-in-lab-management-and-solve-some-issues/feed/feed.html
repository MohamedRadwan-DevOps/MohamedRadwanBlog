Hi Paul,
I agree with you about the Microsoft help is very vague, this why I do it as try and error and I share all the errors I face, anyway

Yes the machine will be connected to your network and will has static IP address, consider it as any machine, 

don&#039;t concern about the IP and the network isolation IP, you configure the normal IP and the feature configure the Network Isolation IP, so just give the domain a static IP within the range of your network and configure the DNS too.

in a simple word consider this domain as a normal machine connected to your normal network.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mohamed,

Do you have or can you point me to any detailed instructions on creating the Domain Controller vm for use in a Network Isolated environment?

The microsoft help is very vague, and doesn&#039;t describe the virtual networking that the vm should use when being created.  

I.e. 
Should the vm be connected to our network initially? 
If so should it use a static ip address or dhcp?
If a static address, should it be a specific address in the network isolation subnet defined in tfs?
etc. etc.

Thanks,

Paul]]></description>
