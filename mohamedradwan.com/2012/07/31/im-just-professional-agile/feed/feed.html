You are completely right, but what I am talking about here, people go for Agile because it&#039;s less comprehensive but they are NOT AGILE, so I prefer if they work using other approach but they refuse, so they are not Agile and they are not traditional either, and this our problem, we take the name of the Agile, so they just apply Agile because it very easy to start developing software without having well define requirements, without having restricted process and many other features of less restriction and they leave why they can do that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Business owners need to see &quot;measured&quot; results (successful project, less money, less time). And actually, there are few real agile projects that showed these measured results to business owners. This is the case inside and outside Egypt. If you can count, 10, 20 or even 500 successful agile projects, that wouldn&#039;t be enough compared to non-agile projects that are successful (from business owners point of view).

It&#039;s our responsibility (agile fans) to provide successful Agile projects to the market. Its success should be well documented, well understood, and well measured by business owners.

This way, and only this way, we can force the companies to adopt the real agile. If we can&#039;t do this, we&#039;ll be just rotating in a closed circle, we want to apply real agile, and companies insist to apply their own agile, we aren&#039;t able to convince them, and they aren&#039;t able to convince us, in an endless scenario.

My best wishes.]]></description>
