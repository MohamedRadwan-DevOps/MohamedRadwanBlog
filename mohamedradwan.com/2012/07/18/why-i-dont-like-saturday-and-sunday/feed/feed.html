Thanks Shehata for your reply and thanks for your agreement with me, why I said that because there are a lot of people working in weekends and all the week but with very few output specially in the quality dimension and this is because we are not believe in &quot;Sharpen your ax &quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOL, you&#039;re right Radwan about the last part, we sleep hard :P, I think the social media had it&#039;s effect on us, now most people spending much time in Facebook and twitter even more than work, our revolution and politics takes a good part of our daily life and that&#039;s even affecting our focus, who can focus in such situations and updates! .
Sunday was the beginning of a new working week, I used to spend much of that day exploring mail, do reply, checking back my tasks paused on Thursday, if we can manage our time better way we could do something good ISA :).]]></description>
