					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] More InfoIf you would like to learn more about what is the story behind containers and what drives or the needs for it, we will know why companies moved from traditional solution architecture to Microservices and how this put containers as the perfect solution for running them, we will get quick intro to clear some definitions, tools and keywords related to this ecosystem, for example, we will understand what is the different between VM, Container and Hyper-V Container, why we would prefer container over VM and when the VM is better, we will understand the different between container and image and know the life cycle of creating a new image and why I do that, like adding more layers to the base image, push that to container images registry on the cloud, then pull that from the registry to anywhere to have a new container. We will understand also different technologies and services around container, like Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Azure Container Services (ACS), Azure Container Registry, etc.- have a look at this post &#8211; have a look at the this post [&#8230;]]]></description>
