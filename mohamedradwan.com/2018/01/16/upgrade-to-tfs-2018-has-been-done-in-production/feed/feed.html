					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
 Your site is very helpful with the right content. Thanks for putting this together. 
Question:
1. If we migrate to VSTS do we still need to install TFS 2018 on Prem?
2. If we are on VSTS how do we perform Build and Release of code if the DB and ssis Servers are on Prem and dont have IIS on them? Do we need to have an agent on-prem ?]]></description>
